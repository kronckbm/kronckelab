								<h2>What is the significance of genetic variants to those that carry them?</h2>
							</header>
							<p>The increasing use of next generation sequencing in the clinical arena is uncovering a large number of variants across all genes, but methods to predict their pathogenicity are not well established. This results in an increasing number of “variants of uncertain significance” (VUSs), a major emerging problem in genomic medicine. Rare variants (mutations) in the cardiac ion channels are implicated in diverse heart diseases, including, long QT syndrome (LQTS), short QT syndrome (SQTS), and Brugada syndrome (BrS), but are also common in healthy populations. While multiple algorithms predict whether ion channel variants are deleterious (SIFT, PolyPhen-2, PredSNP, CADD, etc.), too many neutral variants are classified as disease-causing. The long-term research interest of the laboratory is to improve our understanding of the clinical burden of ion channel non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on carriers. I believe predicting protein-specific functional phenotypes accurately of nsSNPs within these genes is the best path to reaching this goal. Our initial efforts will focus on the ion channels associated with LQT1, LQT2, LQT3, and LQT5.</p>

									<h3>Perturbation of ion channel function and relationship to disease</h3>

								<div class="row 200%">
									<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
										<p>Current prediction algorithms fail to predict the effects of nsSNPs due in part to the inability of models to account for the many factors that prevent complete penetrance—noise from complicating genetic and environmental risk factors buries the protein-specific functional signal. To help illustrate this point I curated a set of nearly 1,400 nsSNPs from the available literature on SCN5A, including 304 variants that were at least partially functionally characterized. What I learned can be summarized as follows:
										There is a range of tolerated NaV1.5 perturbation. There is also a range of perturbation that is not well tolerated. In both these extremes, clinical presentation is largely homogeneous. However, modest perturbations result in varied clinical presentations that are heterogeneous. This trend holds when comparing among different variants, but also holds within the population of carriers of a single variant (Table 1).
										I believe predicting SCN5A variant function will be more informative to an accurate risk of clinical presentation, probabilistically, and will enable the more consistent use of in silico methods in clinical diagnosis.</p>

								<h3>Predicting ion channel function</h3>
								</header>
							<p>My laboratory aims to address the challenge of VUSs by blending experimental and computational strategies: 1) determine structure and flexibility-induced changes from selected ion channel variants using a combination of Rosetta modeling, molecular dynamics in AMBER, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 2) generate experimental deep mutational scanning data sensitive to trafficking/functionally defective ion channel variants. 3) functionally characterize variants in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). These technologies enable us to construct predictive models of ion channel phenotypes and validate the resulting predictions.</p>
							<p><b>Computational and experimental structural biology.</b> The ultimate goal of generating phenotypes of any ion channel nsSNP is only currently possible <i>in silico</i>. The current ability to computationally predict protein structure is still a developing field, especially for membrane proteins; predicting membrane protein flexibility <i>ab initio</i> is even less developed. To help guide structural modeling of NaV1.5 efforts, my laboratory will experimentally structurally characterize domains of ion channels using NMR. Further, we will develop fully solvated, full-atom trajectories of ion channels for comparison with NMR experimental data and for high-throughput variant flexibility determination <i>in silico</i>. The advantage of this approach is the capability of more high-throughput parallel running of variants <i>in silico</i> than could be concievably determined experimentally.</p>
							<p><b>Deep mutational scanning</b>. Computational approaches will never eclipse the need for experimental data of some resolution. For example, although it has been known for years that destabilization-induced mistrafficking is the most common underlying cause for loss-of-function variants of proteins in general, computationally predicting changes in membrane protein stability due to missense mutations remains an unsolved challenge. To complement large-scale variant characterization done computationally, my laboratory will assay functionality of all codon substitutions within targeted 100 residue segments in LQTS-implicated ion channels. A modified HEK cell line generated by the Fowler laboratory at the University of Washington and shared with the Roden laboratory at Vanderbilt enables very high-throughput analysis of variants though at relatively low resolution. The cell line allows for the incorporation of a single plasmid at a specific locus in an individual HEK cell genome which can then be sequenced and quantitated following a selection assay.</p>
							<p><b>hiPSC-CM.</b> The relationship between function of ion channel variants characterized by heterologous expression and resulting action potential perturbations in people is not always straight forward. Though the there is a clear correlation between SCN5A variant perturbation measured by heterologous expression and clinical presentation, there are variants where relatively high minor allele frequency (MAF, as measured by gnomAD) conflicts with the severity of functional perturbation. This begs the question of whether the degree of perturbation is tolerable or whether the heterologous expression data are not representative of the true phenotypes in human cardiomyocytes. My laboratory will test ion channel variant phenotypes in the hiPSC-CM model system. This model system allows for a direct assessment of the variant-specific perturbation against isogenic controls. The process takes approximately 30-40 days for cells to reach maturity. In the best-case scenario, running all variants in parallel, genome editing, differentiation into myocytes, and electrophysiological characterization can be completed in three months. </p>
