								<h2>We have open positions for Postdoc and Research Assistant starting Jan. 01, 2019</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My laboratory aims to address the challenge of VUSs by blending experimental and computational strategies: 1) determine structure and flexibility-induced changes from selected ion channel variants using a combination of Rosetta modeling, molecular dynamics in AMBER, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 2) generate experimental deep mutational scanning data sensitive to trafficking/functionally defective ion channel variants. 3) functionally characterize variants in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). These technologies enable us to construct predictive models of ion channel phenotypes and validate the resulting predictions.</p><p><b>Working at Vanderbilt:</b> Vanderbilt is a renowned private institution founded in 1873 located a little more than a mile from downtown Nashville, TN. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+nashville+TN+so+great%3F" class="icon fa-envelope-o"><span class="label">(Why should I want to work in Nashville?)</span></a>
