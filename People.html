		<p>My long-term research interests are to explain the interplay between membrane protein flexibility and structure that lead to robust function and dysfunction involved in human disease, with a special emphasis on the ion channels involved in the heart contraction cycle. My goal is to develop ion channel-specific predictive algorithm—leveraging sequence, structural, and phenotype data—capable of accurately predicting the phenotype of any point mutation within the molecule. Given the high estimated frequency of SCN5A mutation carriers of nearly 4%, the driving force of this project is not only to provide a reliable estimate of if a variant is pathogenic, but also if a variant is not pathogenic. For my graduate work, I focused on experimental methods development for determining membrane protein flexibility and membrane protein structure. As a graduate student I cultivated a diverse set of skills related to protein structural biology including current PCR techniques, membrane protein expression and purification, EPR, solution NMR, and a working knowledge of protein crystallography. As a Postdoctoral Fellow, I augmented my experimental skillset by furthering my knowledge of membrane protein biophysical methods including NMR and membrane protein structural modelling. During my postdoctoral work I have been exposed to translational opportunities of experimental and computational structural biology, through a collaboration with the Al George laboratory and through Vanderbilt’s translational research initiative Vanderbilt’s Program in Molecular Medicine. The last two years of my training focused on learning from experts in the fields of cardiac arrhythmia genetics (Dan Roden), and computational phenotype-predictive modeling (Jens Meiler and Jeffrey Blume) to construct predictive models of ion channel phenotypes and validate the resulting predictions.
