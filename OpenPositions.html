								<h2>We have open positions for Postdoc and Research Assistant starting Jan. 01, 2019</h2>
							</header>
							<p>My laboratory aims to address the challenge of VUSs in cardiac ion channels by blending experimental and computational strategies: 1) determine structure and flexibility-induced changes from selected ion channel variants using a combination of Rosetta modeling, molecular dynamics in AMBER, and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). 2) generate experimental deep mutational scanning data sensitive to trafficking/functionally defective ion channel variants. 3) functionally characterize variants in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). These technologies enable us to construct predictive models of ion channel phenotypes and validate the resulting predictions.</p><p><b>Working at Vanderbilt:</b> Vanderbilt is a renowned private institution founded in 1873 located a little more than a mile from downtown Nashville, TN. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=why+is+nashville+TN+so+great%3F">(Why should I want to work in Nashville?)</a>

									<h3>Postdoc Position</h3>
								</header>
                  <p><b>Job Duties:</b> 75% Pursue an independent research project to investigate the significance of cardiac ion channel variants to the individuals who carry them. 25% Assist with training staff and laboratory maintenance (Nanion patchliner and publicly available datasets and websites).</p>
                  <p><b>Minimum Qualifications:</b> PhD in Biology/Chemistry/Biochemistry, Genomics/Genetics, Bioinformatics or related field. Previous experience working with ion channels, especially planar patch clamp methodologies, human induced pluripotent stem cell differentiation to cardiomyocytes or high-throughput cell-based assays is desired. Strong verbal and written communication skills are essential. Salary will be set commensurate with experience and accomplishments as well as NIH guidelines. To apply, candidates must submit a letter of application, along with a CV including list of publications and three letters of recommendation, to brett.kroncke@gmail.com.</p>
